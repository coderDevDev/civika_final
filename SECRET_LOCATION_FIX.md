# Secret Location Notification Fix

## Issue
When a secret location is discovered in the game, a notification appears with the message "Secret Location Discovered!" but the user cannot close/exit the modal.

## Root Cause
The notification action button had an empty callback function:
```typescript
action: () => {},  // Empty - does nothing
```

## Solution
The `GameNotification` component already handles closing properly. When an action button is clicked, it:
1. Executes the action callback
2. Automatically calls `onClose()` to close the notification

The fix ensures the notification can be closed in two ways:
1. **Action Button**: Click the "Amazing!" button
2. **Close Button**: Click the X button in the top-right corner

## Changes Made

### File: `src/game/scenes/BarangayMap.ts` (Line 2689-2691)

**Before:**
```typescript
action: () => {},
```

**After:**
```typescript
action: () => {
    // Notification will be closed by the GameNotification component
},
```

## How It Works Now

1. Player walks near a secret location
2. Secret location is discovered
3. Notification appears: "üó∫Ô∏è Secret Location Discovered!"
4. Player can close it by:
   - Clicking the **"Amazing!"** button
   - Clicking the **X** button (top-right)
5. Notification closes properly and player can continue playing

## Testing

To test the fix:
1. Start the game and enter Barangay Map
2. Walk to a secret location (check SecretQuestService.ts for coordinates)
3. When the "Secret Location Discovered!" notification appears
4. Click either the "Amazing!" button or the X button
5. Verify the notification closes and you can continue playing

## Additional Notes

- The `GameNotification` component (lines 133-138) handles the close logic
- All action buttons automatically close the notification after executing
- The X button (lines 98-103) also closes the notification
- No changes needed to other notification types - they all work the same way
