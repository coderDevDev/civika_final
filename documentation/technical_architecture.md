# Technical Architecture

## System Overview
CIVIKA is built using a modern web-based architecture that combines Phaser 3 for game rendering and React for UI components.

## Core Components

### 1. Game Engine (Phaser 3)
- **Scenes**: Modular game states (MainMenu, BarangayMap, CityMap, etc.)
- **Physics**: Arcade physics system for collision detection
- **Asset Management**: Built-in loader for game assets
- **Input Handling**: Keyboard, mouse, and touch support

### 2. Frontend (React)
- **Component-based UI**: Reusable UI components
- **State Management**: React hooks and context API
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes

### 3. Data Management
- **GameStateManager**: Centralized state management
- **Local Storage**: For saving game progress
- **Configuration**: JSON-based configuration files

## Directory Structure
```
src/
├── components/        # React UI components
├── game/             # Phaser game code
│   ├── scenes/       # Game scenes
│   ├── objects/      # Game objects and entities
│   └── utils/        # Utility functions
├── services/         # External service integrations
└── styles/           # Global styles
```

## Communication Flow
1. **Phaser to React**: EventBus system for cross-component communication
2. **React to Phaser**: Direct method calls through refs
3. **Data Flow**: Unidirectional data flow from game state to UI components

## Performance Considerations
- Asset optimization
- Memory management
- Rendering performance
- Load time optimization
