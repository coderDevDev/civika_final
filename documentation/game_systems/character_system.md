## Technical Implementation

### 1. Data Structure
```typescript
interface Character {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  level: number;
  experience: number;
  attributes: {
    strength: number;
    intelligence: number;
    charisma: number;
    endurance: number;
    luck: number;
  };
  skills: Record<string, number>;
  inventory: Item[];
  equipment: {
    head?: Item;
    body?: Item;
    legs?: Item;
    feet?: Item;
    accessory1?: Item;
    accessory2?: Item;
  };
  appearance: {
    // Visual customization data
  };
  stats: {
    health: number;
    maxHealth: number;
    // Other derived stats
  };
}
```

### 2. Save/Load System
- Character data serialization
- Version control for save files
- Auto-save functionality

## Integration with Other Systems

### 1. Combat System
- Attribute-based combat calculations
- Ability cooldowns and effects
- Status effects and buffs/debuffs

### 2. Quest System

- Dialogue options affected by skills
- Reputation-based quest availability

### 3. Inventory System

- Item requirements and restrictions
- Weight and encumbrance

## Best Practices
1. Always validate character data before saving
2. Use events for character state changes
3. Implement proper error handling for invalid states
4. Consider performance for frequently updated values
