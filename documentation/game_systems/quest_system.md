# Quest System

## Overview
The quest system in CIVIKA is designed to provide engaging storylines and meaningful gameplay progression through structured objectives and rewards.

## Quest Types

### 1. Main Story Quests
- Drive the primary narrative forward
- Unlock new areas and features
- Feature significant character development
- Required to complete the game

### 2. Side Quests
- Optional content
- Provide additional world-building
- Offer unique rewards
- Can affect game world state

### 3. Daily/Repeatable Quests
- Refresh on a timer
- Provide consistent rewards
- Encourage regular play
- Often tied to in-game events

## Quest Structure

### 1. Quest Components
- **Title & Description**: Clear objective and narrative context
- **Objectives**: Specific tasks to complete
- **Rewards**: Experience, items, currency, or unlocks
- **Prerequisites**: Requirements to start the quest
- **Time Limits**: Optional time constraints

### 2. Quest States
```typescript
type QuestState = 'available' | 'in_progress' | 'ready_to_complete' | 'completed' | 'failed';
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. Quest Data Structure
```typescript
interface Quest {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  type: 'main' | 'side' | 'daily' | 'event';
  state: QuestState;
  objectives: Objective[];
  rewards: QuestReward[];
  prerequisites: string[]; // Quest IDs
  giver: string; // NPC ID
  turnIn: string; // NPC ID
  minLevel?: number;
  requiredFactionStanding?: FactionRequirement[];
  flags: Record<string, boolean>;
}

interface Objective {
  id: string;
  type: 'kill' | 'collect' | 'talk' | 'explore' | 'use' | 'craft';
  target: string; // ID of target entity/item/location
  requiredAmount: number;
  currentAmount: number;
  description: string;
  hidden: boolean;
}
```

### 2. Quest Tracking
- Active quest tracking in UI
- Objective progress indicators
- Map markers for quest locations
- Journal entries for completed quests

## Integration with Other Systems

### 1. Dialogue System
- Quest acceptance and completion dialogues
- Dynamic dialogue based on quest progress
- Branching conversations

### 2. Inventory System
- Item collection objectives
- Required items for quests
- Quest-specific items

### 3. Character System
- Level requirements
- Skill checks
- Faction reputation effects

## Best Practices
1. Use unique IDs for all quests and objectives
2. Implement proper quest state validation
3. Handle edge cases (inventory full, character death, etc.)
4. Provide clear feedback for quest updates
5. Test quests thoroughly for sequence breaks

## Example Quest Flow
1. Player talks to NPC with available quest
2. Quest details are shown in dialogue
3. Player accepts quest
4. Objectives appear in quest log
5. Player completes objectives
6. Player returns to quest giver
7. Rewards are given upon completion
