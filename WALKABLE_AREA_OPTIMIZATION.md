# Walkable Area Optimization Guide

## 🎯 Problem
"Even in areas without polygons, the player cannot move" - This means collision shapes might be blocking too much walkable space.

## ✅ Current Setup (All Good!)

### **Player Settings:**
- ✅ `setCollideWorldBounds(false)` - Unlimited movement
- ✅ Camera bounds: `Infinity` - No camera restrictions
- ✅ Player speed: `120` - Good speed
- ✅ Player collision: `60%` - Optimized

### **Background:**
- ✅ Scales to cover game canvas
- ✅ Responsive to all screen sizes
- ✅ Positioned at center

---

## 🔍 Likely Issues

### **1. Too Many/Large Collision Polygons**
Your CityMap has **30 collision shapes** - they might be covering too much area!

### **2. Overlapping Polygons**
Multiple polygons might overlap, creating larger blocked areas than intended.

### **3. Edge Polygons**
Polygons at map edges might prevent movement to certain areas.

---

## 🛠️ How to Fix

### **Solution 1: Review Collision Shapes in Editor**

1. **Open Collision Editor:**
   ```
   Press ESC → Collision Editor → Select CityMap
   ```

2. **Check What You See:**
   - Are there polygons covering walkable paths?
   - Are polygons too large?
   - Do polygons overlap unnecessarily?

3. **Delete Unnecessary Shapes:**
   - Click "↖️ Select" mode
   - Click shape to select
   - Click "🗑️ Delete Selected"
   - Remove shapes blocking walkable areas

4. **Make Shapes Smaller:**
   - Delete large polygon
   - Redraw smaller polygon around just the building
   - Leave paths and open areas clear

---

### **Solution 2: Increase Collision Padding**

Make collisions even LESS sensitive:

**File:** `src/services/CollisionService.ts`

**Current Settings:**
```typescript
// Line 149
const COLLISION_PADDING = 0.1; // 10% padding for rectangles

// Line 217  
const TILE_PADDING = 0.15; // 15% padding for polygons
```

**Increase to:**
```typescript
// More forgiving rectangles
const COLLISION_PADDING = 0.2; // 20% padding (40% smaller!)

// More forgiving polygons
const TILE_PADDING = 0.25; // 25% padding (50% smaller!)
```

**Effect:**
- Collision shapes become 40-50% smaller
- Player can walk much closer
- More walkable space

---

### **Solution 3: Reduce Tile Size for Polygons**

Make polygon tiles larger = fewer tiles = more gaps:

**File:** `src/services/CollisionService.ts` (Line 213)

**Current:**
```typescript
const tileSize = 20; // Small tiles = accurate but tight
```

**Change to:**
```typescript
const tileSize = 30; // Larger tiles = more gaps for walking
```

**Effect:**
- Fewer collision tiles
- More space between tiles
- Easier to walk through narrow areas

---

### **Solution 4: Check Specific Problem Areas**

**Test These Areas:**

1. **Spawn Point:**
   - Where does player start?
   - Is there a polygon blocking spawn?

2. **Pathways:**
   - Can player walk between buildings?
   - Are paths clear of polygons?

3. **Open Areas:**
   - Are there polygons in empty spaces?
   - Should be NO polygons in walkable areas

---

## 🎮 Testing Workflow

### **Step 1: Enable Debug Mode**

**File:** `src/game/scenes/BarangayMap.ts` or `CityMap.ts`

Find this line (around line 100):
```typescript
private readonly DEBUG_SHOW_COLLISIONS: boolean = false;
```

Change to:
```typescript
private readonly DEBUG_SHOW_COLLISIONS: boolean = true;
```

**Result:** You'll see RED/BLUE outlines showing exact collision boundaries!

---

### **Step 2: Test Movement**

1. Run game: `npm run dev`
2. Try walking in all directions
3. Note where you get stuck
4. Check if there's a visible collision shape (red/blue outline)

---

### **Step 3: Fix in Editor**

1. Open Collision Editor
2. Find the problematic shape
3. Either:
   - Delete it (if not needed)
   - Make it smaller
   - Redraw more accurately

## 📊 Recommended Collision Coverage

### **Good Coverage:**
```
Map Layout:
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ ████  Path  ████        │  ← Buildings have collision
│ ████        ████        │
│                         │  ← Open areas NO collision
│      Path               │
│                         │
│ ████        ████  Path │
│ ████        ████        │
└─────────────────────────┘

Coverage: ~40-50% of map
Player can walk: 50-60% of map ✅
```

### **Too Much Coverage (Problem):**
```
Map Layout:
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ ████████████████████    │  ← Too many polygons!
│ ████████████████████    │
│ ████████████████████    │  ← Player stuck!
│ ████████████████████    │
│ ████████████████████    │
│ ████████████████████    │
│ ████████████████████    │
└─────────────────────────┘

Coverage: ~80-90% of map
Player can walk: 10-20% of map ❌
```

## 🎯 Quick Fixes

### **Option A: Increase Padding (Easiest)**
```typescript
// CollisionService.ts
const COLLISION_PADDING = 0.25; // 25% instead of 10%
const TILE_PADDING = 0.3; // 30% instead of 15%
```
**Result:** 50-60% smaller collisions instantly!

---

### **Option B: Remove Edge Polygons**
1. Open Collision Editor
2. Delete polygons at map edges
3. Keep only building/obstacle polygons
4. Save changes

---

### **Option C: Simplify Complex Polygons**
1. Find large complex polygons (many points)
2. Delete them
3. Replace with simple rectangles
4. Or smaller, simpler polygons

---

## 🔧 Recommended Settings

### **For Maximum Walkable Space:**

**CollisionService.ts:**
```typescript
// Line 149 - Rectangles
const COLLISION_PADDING = 0.2; // 20% padding

// Line 213 - Polygon tile size
const tileSize = 30; // Larger tiles

// Line 217 - Polygon padding
const TILE_PADDING = 0.25; // 25% padding
```

**Effect:**
- Rectangles: 60% of original size (40% reduction)
- Polygons: 50% of original size (50% reduction)
- Much more walkable space! ✅

## 📝 Checklist

- [ ] Enable `DEBUG_SHOW_COLLISIONS = true`
- [ ] Test walking in all directions
- [ ] Open Collision Editor
- [ ] Check for unnecessary polygons
- [ ] Delete polygons in walkable areas
- [ ] Increase padding values
- [ ] Test again
- [ ] Disable debug mode when done

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Only add collision to solid objects:**
   - Buildings ✅
   - Walls ✅
   - Large obstacles ✅
   - Paths ❌
   - Open grass ❌
   - Empty spaces ❌

2. **Leave gaps between buildings:**
   - Player needs space to walk
   - Don't connect building polygons
   - Keep pathways clear

3. **Test on mobile:**
   - Smaller screen = less visible area
   - Ensure mobile players can navigate

4. **Use simple shapes:**
   - Rectangles for simple buildings
   - Polygons only for complex shapes
   - Fewer shapes = better performance

**Cause:** Collision shapes covering too much area  
**Solution:** 
1. Increase padding (easiest)
